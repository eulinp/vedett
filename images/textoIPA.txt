IPA
Winner of the World Beer Awards 2017
The inventors of Indian Pale Ale may have originally added extra hops to help it survive the long voyage to India. But we just do it for the taste!

Every drop as thirst-quenching as the last, Vedett IPA offers an explosion of flavoursome bitterness that increases with intensity towards the finish, tempered by an unparalleled velvety smoothness resulting in a very accessible taste.

Fresh, fruity and floral notes give way to touches of caramel sweetness, while its superb, lingering aftertaste continues to tantalise the tastebuds long after. Hereâ€™s to a great-tasting, refreshing beer!
