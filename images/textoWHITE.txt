Do not adjust your screen! Vedett Extra White is meant to be cloudy! And while this highly refreshing Belgian white ale may be hard to see through, she is a beer you can enjoy with all your (other) senses!

Revel in her refreshing citrus aromas with touches of coriander...

Feel the fulness of her smooth, grainy textureâ€¦ And savour the subtle sweetness of her slightly perfumed, honey-like finish. All that remains is to listen to the sound of contentment as you open the next bottle!
