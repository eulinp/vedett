EXTRA BLOND
If blonds really do have more fun, imagine what theyâ€™d say about Vedett Extra Blond?! After all, who can resist her seductive straw colour and pearly-white head?

Her smooth, malty character with subtly balanced hops? Or her lingering fruitiness with subtle notes of vanilla?

Whatever your weakness, this premium pilsner offers full-bodied, thirst-quenching refreshment from start to finish. With a slightly bitter aftertaste to keep you on your toes.
